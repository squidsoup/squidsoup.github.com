My name is kit, and I'm a software developer in Dunedin, NZ.

I work at the University of Otago in the Faculty of Medicine, mostly with python. 

Outside of work I'm intersted in early american folk music, playing banjo, amateur mycology, gaming, and pottering about at home with my wonderful wife Lisa and son Isaac.
