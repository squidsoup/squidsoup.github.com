My name is kit, and I'm a software developer in Dunedin, NZ.

I work at the University of Otago in the [Faculty of Medicine](http://micn.otago.ac.nz), mostly with [python](http://python.org) and [django](http://djangoproject.com). My area of interest in software is primarily health informatics and web/mobile development.

Please get in touch if you're interested in contacting me about work opportunities, or health IT related projects. If you'd like to know more about my skillset and experience, my resume is available [here](/files/resume.pdf).

Outside of work I'm interested in early American music, playing banjo, amateur mycology, gaming, and pottering about at home with my wonderful wife [Lisa](http://sundayhotpants.nocturne.net.nz) and son Isaac.
